The provided .sln file expects libs binaries to be put in this directory.

Specifically, this is the expected directory structure:

AntTweakBar
assimp-github-minimal
DevIL-SDK-x86-1.7.8-minimal
glew-1.10.0-minimal
glfw-2.7.9-minimal
glm-0.9.4.5-minimal
rapidjson

Binary library files are not expected to be put on GitHub, but for your
convenience I have uploaded a zip file that mirrors the content of the directory
in my private repository (the needed header/binaries, without docs etc).

Just download and extract this file and you should be up and running.

IANAL, but I think this doesn't go against the licenses of such libraries.
Please alert me in case of problems.
