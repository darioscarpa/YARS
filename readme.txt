 - Yet Another Rendering Sandbox -

Status: code cleaning in progress, will be uploaded soon

YARS is a simple, dirty, unfinished rendering sandbox I developed while working on my master thesis.
In its current status, it shouldn't probably used by anyone, except maybe some OpenGL beginner (as I consider myself).
If you absolutely need to find something good about: it's new, so it's written in C++11 and OpenGL 4.3.

More information will follow soon
